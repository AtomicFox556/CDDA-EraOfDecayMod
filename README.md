A mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead game that rewrites some descriptions so as to not have them assume support for any real-world political ideas, instead providing a politically neutral factual description.

Currently changed items include flags, hard hat, summer hard hat, dust mask, and rashguard shirt.
