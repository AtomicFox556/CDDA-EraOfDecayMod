# Era Of Decay mod

A heavily WIP general content mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead game, primarily containing new and altered items and recipes that fit with the vanilla theme. Compatibility with other mods not guaranteed, posting pull requests and issues is encouraged.

## Current features

### New features

Add disassembly recipes for flags (into sheets)

### Changes to vanilla things

Alter some item descriptions so as to not have them assume support for any real-world political ideas, instead providing a politically neutral factual description. This includes descriptions for flags, hard hat, summer hard hat, dust mask, and rashguard shirt.

Flags made to have exactly the same stats as sheets.
